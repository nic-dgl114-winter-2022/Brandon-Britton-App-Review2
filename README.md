# Brandon Britton's App Review 2

## Intro

  The two apps that I will be reviewing are two gaming apps: **Dragalia Lost** and **Sdorica**. In this review, I will cover both game's uses of the following elements and compare them in how they are used. UI elements will be lightly covered first, I will more broadly cover the use of RecyclerView and Activities in both apps, the Activity lifecycle of these apps, and then I will answer what changes I would make to the app if were to be a developer on it.
