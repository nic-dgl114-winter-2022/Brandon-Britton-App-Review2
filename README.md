# Brandon Britton's App Review 2

## Intro

  The two apps that I will be reviewing are two gaming apps: **Dragalia Lost** and **Sdorica**. In this review, I will cover both game's uses of the following elements and compare them in how they are used. UI elements and Activities will be covered first, the use of RecyclerView and Activities in both apps, the Activity lifecycle of these apps, and then I will answer what changes I would make to the app if were to be a developer on it.
  
  _Please note, and I apologize in advance, that all my .gifs were limited to 6 seconds long. As a result, things occur very quickly in them as a result_
