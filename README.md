# Brandon Britton's App Review 2

## Intro

  The two apps that I will be reviewing are two gaming apps: **Dragalia Lost** and **Sdorica**. In this review, I will cover both game's uses of the following elements and compare them in how they are used. UI elements and Activities will be covered first, the use of RecyclerView and Activities in both apps, the Activity lifecycle of these apps, and then I will answer what changes I would make to the app if were to be a developer on it.

## UI Elements and Activities

**Activity Navigation within a View**



REQUIREMENTS
For the purposes of this assignment you will choose two apps to analyze that fall under the same broad category of use (for example, apps in the categories of health, fitness, financial, weather, gaming, communication or any other are acceptable). Your analysis should compare and contrast your chosen apps in terms of their user interface (UI), especially relating to specific "views" (or what I've referred to as Activities in class), and to navigation, as well as the app lifecycle and especially the experience of starting, stopping and resuming use of the app. Your analysis should also continue to consider the same, or similar questions asked in the last app review assignment.
 
The following questions are prompts that are intended to get you thinking about the points above. You need not answer all of them (or even any of them, if you have other equivalent ideas). Think of them as starting points to help you develop your own questions as part of your analysis:
Consider specific and related UI elements in each of your chosen apps (e.g. menus in each of your apps, or data entry views, etc.): Does one app have a "better" interface than the other? Which do you think might be easier, or more challenging to implement?
The RecyclerView is a commonly used layout pattern in Android development; do either of your chosen apps make use of RecyclerView? Are there other layout patterns present in either or both apps that you have seen elsewhere? Do you think that one app makes better use of common layout patterns?
What is the user experience in starting each of your apps? What about stopping, or exiting? Is resuming easy and efficient? How do these experiences compare across both apps?
If you were a developer on one of your chosen apps, what is one change you'd like to make, or one feature you'd like to implement? Which of the two apps would you rather be a developer on? Why?
